curl -X POST https://api.usenarrative.ai/api/v1/sports/highlights \

  -F "video=@football_game.mp4" \
  -F "metadata=@play_metadata.json" \

{
  "task_id": "task_def456xyz",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### What the AI Identifies

Without metadata:
- Exciting commentary moments
- Score announcements
- Crowd reactions
- Replays and big plays

With metadata (enhanced accuracy):
- **Scoring plays** with exact timestamps
- **Turnovers** from possession changes
- **Red zone plays** from field position data
- **Game-changing moments** from score differential

### Next Step

Poll the task status using `GET /api/v1/sports/highlights/{task_id}`:

```bash
curl https://api.usenarrative.ai/api/v1/sports/highlights/task_def456xyz
