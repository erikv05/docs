### Notes

- Processing time varies based on video length (typically 5-10 minutes for a 2-hour video)
- The AI identifies: touchdowns, interceptions, fumbles, big plays, and exciting commentary moments
- Optional metadata file improves timestamp accuracy for sports broadcasts
- Editorial instructions allow customization (e.g., "Include crowd reactions", "End with celebration")
- Output video URL is valid for 24 hours

### Enhanced Highlights with Vision Metadata

For more accurate highlights, use the Vision endpoints to extract play-by-play metadata first:

1. **[Detect ROIs](/api-reference/clipping/detect-rois)** - Identify scoreboard elements in your broadcast
2. **[Extract Metadata](/api-reference/clipping/extract-metadata)** - Generate play-by-play events with precise timestamps
3. **Generate Football Highlights** - Pass the metadata for enhanced accuracy

When metadata is provided, the AI cross-references:
- **Scoring plays** with exact timestamps from score changes
- **Turnovers** detected from possession changes
- **Red zone plays** from field position data
- **Game-changing moments** from score differential analysis

```bash
# Full workflow with metadata
curl -X POST https://api.usenarrative.ai/api/v1/highlights/generate \
  -F "video=@football_game.mp4" \
  -F "metadata=@play_metadata.json" \
  -F "editorial_instructions=Focus on scoring plays and turnovers"
```
