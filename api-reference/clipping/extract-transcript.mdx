### Notes

- Transcription uses state-of-the-art speech recognition
- Speaker diarization identifies unique speakers (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.)
- Timestamps are precise to the hundredth of a second
- The `full_text` field provides the complete transcript without timestamps
- Supports multiple languages (auto-detected)
